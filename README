The Agriculture and Natural Resources department at Berea College runs a mid-sized farm that produces beef and pork products. The beef and pork products
 are then sold to Berea College’s food service, bookstore and at the farmer’s market. The department currently uses a spreadsheet to inventory the 
 products they sell. This has become cumbersome because they have to have too much repetitive information in the spreadsheet that has made it difficult 
 to keep track of the inventory. Therefore, they want us to develop a web enable application that will make it easier for them to enter and update data about the
 products they sell.Also, plans are in place to use barcodes to capture information about their products in the future. Thus, the application should have
 this capability. At the moment, they are not interested in the database storing the information about products sold to food service or the farmer’s 
 market. They want the application to be used primarily for products sold at the farmer’s market.
